= dashboard

Welcome to dashboard! This document will guide you in using the dashboard as per your needs. But before proceeding to *how*, let us understand *what* is it and *why* has it been developed.

== Overview

The dashboard is your one stop destination for all your `devonfw-ide` needs. It serves as a UI on top of `devonfw-ide`.

Are you new to `devonfw`? You can download and setup the latest `devonfw-ide` from *dashboard* and link:home-page[get started]. Or if you prefer, you can also link:settings-page[download] one of our older `devonfw-ide` versions available from our maven repository. The dashboard will be a fantastic introduction to `devonfw` as it encapsulates all that `devonfw` offers.

Or if you are already using `devonfw-ide`, you can link:settings-page[update] it's settings and software to the latest versions available.

If you are an existing user, you will find all your link:projects-page[projects] created under your `workspaces` directory spread across your different `devonfw-ide` versions (2020.04.003 or higher) all in one place in the dashboard. You can also create new (`devon4ng`, `devon4j` and `devon4node`) projects from within the dashboard and manage it from there itself.

You can launch any of your most used link:ides-page[IDE's] (VS Code, Eclipse or IntelliJ) from your active `devonfw-ide` intsance.

You can also go through the list of `devonfw` link:repositories-page[repositories], open any one of them up in the browser or copy their URL for cloning locally.

You also have the `devonfw` link:wiki-page[wiki] to know more about `devonfw` right from within the *dashboard*.

== Motivation

The `devon-ide` is a collections of tools and software which you can configure and customize as per your requirements. It ships with a number of command line tools under an umbrella `devon` command.

The main motivation behind *dashboard* is to provide a user interface on top of this collection of command line tools. So it can do (almost) everything that the `devonfw-ide` could and more.

It was also developed to serve as a single point of contact for the most common `devonfw` tasks. You can have multiple `devonfw-ide`s of different versions, each holding multiple projects and softwares configured differently. With *dashoard* you can manage all your projects from the same place.
